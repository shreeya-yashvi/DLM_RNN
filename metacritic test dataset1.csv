La La Land,10,"Damien Chazelle’s La La Land is a dazzling romantic musical that celebrates dreams and examines the sacrifices needed to achieve them. Starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, the film follows Sebastian, a jazz purist longing to open his own club, and Mia, an aspiring actress chasing ****. Their love story intertwines with their struggles to balance personal ambition and their **** against the vibrant backdrop of Los Angeles, La La Land is visually stunning, with choreographed musical numbers that blend nostalgia for classic Hollywood with modern sensibilities. The narrative progresses through the seasons, mirroring the evolution of Mia and Sebastian’s romance—from its charming beginnings to its bittersweet conclusion.While their differing goals create tension, the film explores how their connection inspires both to pursue their dreams. Gosling and Stone deliver magnetic performances, with Emma Stone’s portrayal of Mia earning her an Academy Award. The soundtrack, featuring hits like ""City of Stars,"" adds emotional depth to the **** film’s imaginative finale—a dreamlike sequence envisioning an alternate ending—captures the tension between love and ambition. Ultimately, La La Land is a heartfelt ode to dreamers, celebrating the beauty and cost of following one’s passions.",positive
La La Land,10,"The song ""City of Stars"" as a duet encapsulates this film when it plays—calm, light, full of the characters' dreams and desires. A beautiful film. 10/10.",positive
La La Land,6,"""La La Land"" does combine Chazelle's fun camerawork with good acting and an interesting musical tone, but it's story doesn't give us enough, and its music feels mostly average. Some of the pivotal moments in the story happen off-screen, and the rest leaves us mostly unsatisfied, there can be a profound message in a lack of satisfaction, but it's story needs more context. The visuals are well done, the camera feels as though it dances with the characters in every scene, but the story and music leave a lot to be desired.",positive
La La Land,3,"I found this movie to be an insult to jazz. The script is trivial, the actors are not the best suited for a musical. I liked none of Chazelle's three films but I found this one to be his worst.",negative
La La Land,3,"I didn't like the story much. It has some good moments but not a lot. What the hell was I watching? Very overrated movie. I put off seeing it as I'm not really into musicals. I had to force myself to watch it all the way through and now I feel worse for having seen it. Universal acclaim, man, your opinion may differ.",negative
La La Land,9,"... what have I done... I can never unsee this masterpiece... BRILLIANT - HEART-WRENCHING - THOUGHT-PROVOKING weeping, longing, dying, laughing, unblinking, desperately hoping...",positive
La La Land,10,Damien Chazelle has created another beautiful and tragic film. The characters are fresh and exciting and the filming is unparalleled to any other musical.,positive
La La Land,10,"I mean, it's just perfect. The musics, the story, everything is perfect. Probably the best movie of all time",positive
La La Land,10,"Another musical masterpiece by chazelle, amazing and fantastic performance by gosling and stone.this is a must watch movie",positive
Pinnochio,6,okay young Disney even though this bombed this is an improvement its funny and dark but also the problem is that the ending fells a bit to fast paced,positive
Pinnochio,8,"Disney's second big-time animated feature looks markedly better than Snow White, no small feat, but otherwise falls a little short of meeting that first film's high standard. ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" notwithstanding, the songs aren't as memorable, the foil isn't as well-defined and the plot is less focused. Which isn't to trash the whole effort - it's still an incredibly charming, timeless creative success - but I'd consider it a slight letdown in a few crucial areas. Pinocchio himself is as inherently innocent as they come. That's an essential part of his character, but it leads him into a lot of easily-avoided trouble. Somewhat frustrating to watch, as he fails to learn from countless mistakes and warnings, but it could be argued that such is childhood in a nutshell. The mythical ""get out of jail free"" card he carries, an extremely forgiving (and slightly unnerving) fairy, bails him out of nearly every jam anyway, so the greater dangers ultimately feel rather toothless. The story skips around a lot, bouncing from a jolly family home to a rowdy stage show, a risqué island of naughty indulgence (and puzzling transformation) to the cramped confines of a whale's belly. That gives the visual crew ample opportunity to flex, but also feels excessive and disjointed. More like a series of one-off episodes than a single, cohesive story, at least until the third act. There's also a team of anthropomorphic cats carousing about, causing trouble, which is odd given the otherwise all-human population, and undercuts the fundamental strangeness of a wooden puppet come to life. Disney's wand still has plenty of magic - Pinocchio is a constant visual delight - but in this case, it would benefit from a longer attention span.",positive
Pinnochio,8,"Toymaker Gepetto creates a wooden puppet toy named Pinocchio and wishes that he would be a real boy. Fortunately for him a kind fairy is on hand to do just that. One of the movies from Disney’s so called ‘golden age’, Pinocchio features the fantastic animation, catchy songs and memorable characters that were a hallmark of the company at this time.",positive
Pinnochio,8,"Pinocchio to me is an overrated and overused classic, but that means in no way that it's bad, I LOVE THIS ANIMATION. It is one of the most recognizable animations out there, and While in my eyes not logically the best, because of other characters existing in the same world or certain plot twists that happen, it is an outstanding classic Disney animation, that uses its set-up world to its strengths. I recently watched this again before the Live action a while ago and it holds up pretty well, it's keen, its fun, and it deals with quite bold scenarios you wouldn't expect in a logical sense of perspective. It's an 8/10, a must-watch, and while some small plots and characters don't make sense(It's an animation, it doesn't really matter besides what they represent), or aren't explained well, it still drags you into a world full of delight and sometimes a mystery.",positive
Pinnochio,10,"Disney's 1940's Pinocchio is not only my favorite movie of all time, it's a story so timeless and universal.",positive
Pinnochio,9,"While this may not age well, this is a classic. This has an engaging story, jaw-dropping animation, and memorably likable characters. This is a classic and a must-watch. Watch it while you still can, if you can handle Pinocchio smoking.",positive
Pinnochio,10,Pinocchio is my favorite movie and it is flawless. I love everything about this movie. 10/10,positive
Pinnochio,10,"Being the second Disney film after Snow White, i found myself way more enjoying Pinocchio, the movie have a lot more things to do, it was an amazing story and surprisingly there is some pretty a lot of dark moments too, example the donkey scene, i found it so terrifying, and of course the good old disney animation and the voice acting are all fantastic, overall Pinocchio was another great disney classic.",positive

RRR,3,"The Bollywood style of filmmaking has, arguably, become a distinct genre all its own, characterized by long, visually dazzling movies filled with action sequences on steroids, hyper-energized music video segments (regardless if relevant to the story), and glamorously designed costumes, hair and makeup. It’s definitely an acquired taste and eminently commercial, but it’s not exactly something one could characterize as epic, groundbreaking cinema. Which is why I’m stunned by all of the attention and awards season buzz that’s being showered on this over-the-top offering, one that’s fairly typical of releases in this genre. In this hypothetical “what if” tale about a fictitious meeting between a pair of Indian freedom fighters who struggled against brutal British colonial rule (and who never met in real life), writer-director S.S. Rajamouli takes viewers on a whirlwind action-adventure saga that’s preposterous, predictable, clichéd, at times juvenile, and, above all, exhausting by the time one reaches the end of its 3+-hour runtime. The trite dialogue, corny narrative, cheesy CGI effects (particularly the film’s wild animals) and monodimensional characters (most notably the big bad Brits who come across more like caricatures than villains) are all laughable, almost as much as the film’s fight sequences, which play like scenes from the “John Wick” and “Matrix” franchises with a dash of martial arts flicks thrown in for good measure. In fact, were it not for the seemingly incessant runtime, this might qualify as one of those good “bad” offerings for a group movie night, though the film becomes tiresome about an hour in and can’t adequately sustain that sense of high camp for more than 180 minutes. In its defense, the picture’s choreography in the musical sequences is commendable (if at times it’s like watching a protracted aerobics class), and the costumes, art direction and set design are all noteworthy (save, of course, for a **** marble railing in one scene that looks like the Styrofoam from which it appears to have been made). Given all of the foregoing, however, I’m truly perplexed why this release has been singled out from the other films in this genre as the beneficiary of such generous awards season recognition, perhaps other than the fact that it has been a huge box office hit worldwide, which may well have something to do with that. But is that milestone enough to drive the ample bestowing of such accolades? Remember, popcorn may qualify as a great snack, but it certainly does not a meal make.",negative

RRR,8,"RRR feels like they accomplished an impossible feat by having something for everyone. Action, romance, musical numbers, comedy. It felt like a live action anime movie. My only real complaint is with the musical numbers. They’re used as a way to recap the last 30 minutes of the film or as a way to show the emotions of the current scene. At times it feels unnecessary as if you were paying attention you wouldn’t need to story beats spelled out for you.",positive
RRR,0,"A totally overrated cringefest that is being celebrated by many.I didn't even care about the main objective to save the native girl since they didn't tell the backstory of her so that the viewer can create an emotional bond with her. The one song where the dance together was great but otherwise it's a deformed ramanyana. The underwater walking scene, the all animals in one cage and the escape from prison/final fight were all laughable",negative
RRR,5,It's quite fun but... utterly ridiculous. Not a cerebral piece worthy of the lengthy reviews featured herein.,negative
RRR,1,"I thought going into this movie I will enjoy some classic Bollywood movie. How I was wrong. I am used to exaggerated storylines and over the top acting, but this was too much, even for me. The characters were extremely 2 dimensional for you to even care about them. This overexaggerated plotline only works if the characters are well written and if it can bring you some sympathy towards them. Neither the villain nor the protagonist were likeable. The Bromance came out of nowhere and not convincing. The CGI were terrible and the acting too cheesy, I felt the cheesiness oozing from the screen, and that's not a compliment, I cringed really hard that I had to bail out on the movie",negative
RRR,5,"This movie would have been better if it was a gay love story, since the love interests of both actors have negligible roles anyway. Rajamouli made a terrible mistake by not letting Ramcharan and NTR kiss onscreen.",negative
RRR,9,"This movie was a wild rollercoaster! One moment it's a tragic drama. Next, it's a superhero movie. Next, it's a cheesy, bromance movie. Next, it's a dance musical. Next, it's an intense thriller. Next, it's a rom-com. Next, it's an awesome action movie. Tonally, this movie shouldn't work but it does! It has great storytelling that delivers on the comedy and emotional beats. It also has amazing cinematography and a terrific soundtrack. The action scenes are so amazing and badass. The movie is paced so well, that I forgot it was even 3 hours! One of the main characters throws a tiger onto someone else and beats up people with a motorcycle! That's enough of a reason to watch RRR!",positive
RRR,10,RRR reminded me why I started to watch movies in the first place. RRR is why theaters were built. This is cinema.,positive
RRR,8,I haven't seen a lot of Bollywood films but this was easily the best one that I have seen. So much fun,positive
RRR,8,Chaotic but in a good way is the best way to describe this movie. It’s mostly nonstop energy for the entire 3 hour runtime and that’s the best thing about this movie. The energy of this film is what makes this a must see from 2022 in my eyes. The performances and characters from N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan are great. They both have some great chemistry together and do a great job at developing their characters. S. S. Rajamouli’s direction is really fun and so much better than his directing on B?hubali. The action is some of the most insane I’ve seen put to film ever. It’s something that’s hard to describe and is better being seen by your own eyes. You won’t be disappointed though. It also has probably my favorite dance scene ever put to film as well. I honestly can’t think of anything that tops it. When the film isn’t action oriented or doing something fun then it can really drag. There’s a 30-40 minute portion of the film that really drags on and on. Some of the performances here aren’t exactly amazing also like from Alison Doody. If you want a really fun action and character oriented movie to watch with friends or on your own then I would highly recommend checking this out.,positive
Harry Potter 2,6,"The second half of Harry's grand finale is better than the first, but still struggles to cope with too many characters, too little color and an overstuffed dance card. There's just so much going on, and it's all so excessively dim... Over-reliance upon book lore has been a long-term problem for this franchise, and that issue has only grown more pronounced as the film adaptations enter their final stretch. I have no idea how anyone could make sense of Deathly Hallows 2 without keeping a store of such information, fresh and reliable, somewhere in their noggin. Maybe a Cliff's Notes handbook and a hair-trigger pause button would suffice. Casually tossing about complicated concepts like wand allegiance, multiplying spells, hallows and horcruxes, the film skims along at a high speed, in breathless pursuit of flashier material. Of that, fortunately, there's plenty, and those bits are loaded with well-constructed callbacks to the previous films. The action scenes are constant highlights, excellent in concept and in execution; a fitting farewell, in their own way, for the series at large. Quieter character moments are more of a mixed bag. Snape gets his big spotlight scene, after being completely ignored in Part 1, but most of the younger cast members are swept up in the desperate search for a soul mate. Everybody just wants to pair off, to hit that convenient epilogue with a litter of kids tugging at their shoestrings. Despite simmering for years and years, in many cases, such romances play more like a series of checked boxes than natural, heartfelt outpourings of emotion. Ron and Hermione are a prime example. The moment of their long-germinating embrace was evidently a difficult scene for the actors, who literally grew up together on-set, and their discomfort is clear on the screen. The kiss feels like an awkward, instantly-regretted smooch between friends, not a grand culmination, and that robs power from these beloved characters' storybook ending. They probably should've got that out of the way several movies earlier anyway. Here, in the midst of a hectic chase and a frenzied battle, even an effective payoff would've been lost in the mix. Which is another recurring issue that this film never really settles. There's enough material for three movies in here (or a seven-hundred page book, as it were) and in trying to please everyone, to fit it all in, the whole package fades into a fleeting, dizzying wash. Nothing gets a chance to breathe, lest a different scene meet the cutting room floor. Crucial time is cut from meaningful points in the main narrative, dampening their impact, to cram in a few smaller, crowd-pleasing tidbits. But those, too, are over and done with so quickly that they hardly seem worth the effort. In the end, we get (nearly) everything, without necessitating another weird mid-stream cutaway, but nothing is half as rewarding as I'd expected. A stumble over the finish line, in other words; a film that hits the novel's plot points but completely misses its spirit. Could’ve been worse, I guess, but it also could’ve been so much better.",positive
Harry Potter 3,6,"Lots of cuts, lots of changes, the story gets almost unrecognizable.... I get the impression that Yates is the worst thing that could happen to the “Harry Potter” series!",positive
Harry Potter 4,3,"I dont know why but for me ""Harry Potter"" is boring film. Yeah, it's have some cool moments but not much.",negative
Harry Potter 5,3,Should not have tried to make a lot of changes in movie. Not sure if there was cost cutting needed to avoid animation wherever necessary. Even felt that actor actress were not showing maturity (Did not really tried to act)... Overall worst of the series as in adaptation... Climax fight which is very important... shame on you David,negative
Harry Potter 6,7,"It's not a bad movie by all means, but I might have expected better from it, or there is a possibility I wasn't in a good mood to watch it, lol. Either way, it was full of action, but they may have skipped explaining a few things to rush it to the end. I would say the ending was fair and a good closing to this great series.i never read the books and probably will never do, nevertheless no one can deny the Harry Potter series was part of many of our childhood and many of us probably imagined ourselves holding a wand and doing magical spells and wishing to be in their world :)",positive
Harry Potter 7,8,I enjoyed the series throughout and really is one of the greatest book to movie adaptations we have seen I think in last decades. Great cast and great actors.,positive
Harry Potter 8,9,Yep. It's a great movie. A fantastic end to a fantastic series that I love!,positive
Harry Potter 9,8,"I grew up with Harry Potter, and in my opinion this is a wonderful sendoff for a brilliant series",positive
Harry Potter 10,7,"It's still riddled with the David Yates lack of urgency and lack of making things feel significant between characters, giving life and dynamic to the moment, and is lazy when conveying moments. There is a lifelessness to his directing, and only in transitions do you feel the wakeness after the slumber of execution you sit through. He isn't bad, he's just not a lively director. And for the last 3 films, it was felt incredibly. The movie has some powerful things in it, and I do believe is Yates' best outing yet. But as emotional as the resolve was, I didn't feel the impact, the heartfelt goodbye. Still is a good solid Potter movie that has some high stakes. But I felt Yates wasn't the right director to close out this series.",positive
Harry Potter 11,3,"I dont know why but for me ""Harry Potter"" is boring film. Yeah, it's have some cool moments but not much.",negative
Harry Potter 12,10,"Best film in the series for me. Amazing graphics and special effects. The acting was great and the story was accurate to the books. Loved it. It's a shame that half the cast have gone against Rowling these days and have gone on to spread and believe lies about her and have just betrayed her. Over all though, amazing film.",positive

Harry Potter 15,5,A mildly good ending is let down by endless plot holes and pretentious drama.,negative
Harry Potter 16,8,"A great way to cap off just a good series. There was really only 2 great films in this series, the rest are good. The emotion in this final installment is high, stakes are high, and the believable domination of Voldemort is realized through the actors portrayal and actions on screen. However, Draco Malfoy’s character was wasted, absolutely wasted. You could’ve had a real raw moment with Harry and Draco, absolutely wasted. 70/100",positive
Harry Potter 17,4,i still stand by the first 2 were the best. with the new dumbledore came an entirely different personality than he was supposed to have. they followed closer to the books (as close as they could get) cutting out peeves even in his crucial role towards the end still irritates me. all in all i finished watching it but it leaves too much empty and forgotten.,negative
Harry Potter 18,9,"Whenever the final chapter is now adapted, the final chapter is the end of the series which comforts everybody to ever see the last installment of Harry Potter. Every film from the book series has worked well.",positive
Harry Potter 19,9,"A dazzling, suspenseful end to J.K. Rowling's epic saga, Deathly Hallows: Part 2 reaches the peak of the series' maturity, and is filled with emotion, powerful performances, incredible special effects, and a wonderfully brilliant ending.",positive
Harry Potter 20,5,Felt rushed and time jumpy. There was no real content with this one and I think that's what makes it so disappointing. You do go in with high hopes for the last film of this epic series and it just doesn't liveup.,negative
Harry Potter 21,8,"To be fair, I never read any of the books, so I can simply judge this based on that. Whether it is loyal to the source material or not is of no consequence to me. With that said, I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun. Sure it isn't as good as some of the earlier movies, and the acting still OK-ish, but I still thought it was entertaining.",positive
Avengers:Endgame,8,"It's a very good endpoint for the 10+ year Marvel cinematic universe. It's by no means a masterpiece with regards to the plot or the script, but it is a lot of fun and does conclude the Thanos saga in an interesting way. This is best watched immediately after Infinity war as there's a lot of subtle jokes and references that you won't remember unless you've seen that film recently.",positive

Avengers:Endgame,6,"Massive, sprawling, over-the-top, and overlong—yet for the first time in a long while within the MCU, I felt like I was watching three-dimensional characters (with the exception of Captain Marvel). For that reason, I forgive ENDGAME for a lot:For the fact that the entire plot collapses like a house of cards as soon as you ask even a single question about the storyline. For the fact that it’s impossible to adequately present all the characters and their stories from the previous MCU films, with some getting little more than a cameo. For the fact that the finale of the greatest cinematic saga of our time is little more than a heap of fan service.I barely thought about any of these points during the movie, partly because ENDGAME, despite its three-hour runtime, doesn’t feel like a mere “memberberries” film. If you let yourself get into it, you’ll be quite entertained. And I believe that most comic book lovers never dared to dream of what was presented to them over a decade and has now reached its conclusion.",positive

Avengers:Endgame,0,"After 5 years, I'm still so salty about this movie. Bloated, empty, self-indulgent trash that gave almost every character a terrible ending. I haven't watched an MCU movie since this one. Of all of them, Captain America's ending makes me the angriest, and I'm fairly certain it only exists to convince us that Steve and Bucky aren't gay for each other. Because that's a great basis for a character arc, I guess. Every emotional beat in this movie is so hackneyed and overwrought that I felt like I was watching Dawson's Creek. Also, a lot of the characters weren't necessary for the story at all. Most of the characters had nothing to do, unless you're really interested in watching Thor be an overdone fat joke for the whole movie. What was the point? So much of this should've just been cut. A lot of people say that this was some kind of ""feminist movie"" or ""SJW movie"" or something (whether as a compliment or an insult), but I thought it actually treated most of the female characters pretty badly. Black Widow is the only female avenger, and we all know what happened to her, Captain Marvel doesn't even actually win her fight, and most of the other women (with the exception of Nebula) seemed to only exist as accessories to men's plotlines and emotions.

Avatar:The Way of Water,2,"Avatar: The way of Filler, by a way of cringe even in a good tv series, sometimes you start getting filler episodes, and in series you can sometimes survive them ok. when the whole movie in a movie looks like a filler episode - it is NOT ok at all. the worst about this one - its secondary nature; and nothing feels more secondary in this avatar than everything new that was not in the first movie. i can imagine a target audience as kids, because for me, an adult who loved the first movie, watching this was simply painful experience.",negative
Avatar:The Way of Water,8,"While the film is ultimately a rehash of the first and a setup for the third, I have to admit that I was caught up in the spectacle of it all. Movies this beautiful are a pleasure to watch, even though reflecting on it reminds me of how shallow it was. The chills I had in the theater give me the desire to watch the rest of this series as it goes on.",positive
Avatar:The Way of Water,5,Meh. The Movie feels in many moments like it repeats the story from the first movie.,negative
Avatar:The Way of Water,3,"Beautiful, especially in 3D. Lots of action scenes. Surprisingly dull. The story is so thin and recycled for such a long film. The action scenes feel like cartoons silliness, not an exciting live action movie. If you are a fan of James Cameron and the first Avatar movie you might have the feeling that you are watching a movie that was created from deleted scenes of the Avatar 1 and CG altered scenes of his other films. Most notable were beats from Titanic and The Abyss. Disappointing after waiting all these years for a second film.",negative
Avatar:The Way of Water,1,Cut one hour and 30 minutes and I am in. Way too long for such a plain story. This movie forgot that STORY IS KING,negative
Avatar:The Way of Water,5,"Visually, it's stunning. Storywise, it leaves a lot to be desired.",negative
Avatar:The Way of Water,3,"I wasn’t a fan of the first film beyond the cgi that was at the time very beautiful and novel. This is yet another gross amalgamation of cherry picked qualities and generalizations of indigenous cultures. It’s Dances with Wolves,Pocahontas, and Fern Gulley rolled into one un-fun “adventure.” This seems like the type of film Lefties will love and feel empowered by the whole drive home in their SUV.",negative
Avatar:The Way of Water,10,"This is my favorite movie of all time. So yes, I'm probably pretty biased here. Let's start with the visuals: They are perfect. Just perfect. See it in Imax. I'm not a fan of 3D, but see it in 3D. You'll be blown away. The story is simple, sure. But simple doesn't mean bad. It tells a great story regardless of if it has been told before. It's still a fantastic story of family and living with the herd. The exploration of Earth's beauty through Pandora is breathtaking. If you ask me, this is like going on the Soarin' ride at Disney for 3 hours and 12 minutes, and add a great story on top of that. Simply a wonderful movie.",positive
Avatar:The Way of Water,4,Stunning visuals alone are not enough to make me enjoy a boring 3 hours long movie.,negative
Avatar:The Way of Water,3,Just way too long. So many unnecessary scenes.Could easily knock out 90 min of this. Hence just plain boring most of the time.,negative
Avatar:The Way of Water,8,"As people say this looks really good, but the story is admittedly kinda of the first Avatar but expanded on. I really wish they would add more nuance to the story.",positive
Avatar:The Way of Water,10,Great visuals and design. Story and character development were great. Movie didnt suffer from modern sequel/remake/etc hogwash like other movies where they repeat storylines to play it safe or make extreme changes to characters. Music was great and good voice and actor lineup. Watched it on Disney+ - at 4K it was a Marvel.,positive
Avatar:The Way of Water,6,"I don't think it's a bad movie, but it was just impossible for me to enjoy it due to flat characters and boring, cringy dialogue. Tried a second time and slept like a baby through it, so that's a nice point in its favour I guess?",positive
Avatar:The Way of Water,7,Better than 1st movie but not to my taste Better than 1st movie but not to my taste,positive
Avatar:The Way of Water,5,There are games with much better dialog and plot than this movie. Also PC graphics are getting real close in terms of visual quality and they are rendered in real time. Theis movie is already obsolete. The next ones probably won't make enough to cover the budget.,negative
Avatar:The Way of Water,9,"Avatar The Way of Water is a visually stunning film that is also emotionally engrossing, and a worthy sequel to the original hit. The highest grossing film of all time isn't easy to live up to, and Avatar 2's pacing does suffer from time to time, it feels occasionally clunky because it has to serve as a continuation of a story very much wrapped up, but a prequel to the real meat of the story that's happening the subsequent three sequels. While the film doesn't accomplish all those in strides, it still makes a great theatrical experience.",positive
Avatar:The Way of Water,6,"I think the only and biggest thing that's bad about this movie is the script. Compared to the first movie, the character motivations (especially our antagonist) are very weak. It is hard to know why the characters do what they do. We keep watching scenes of kidnapping and rescue. The visuals and Zoe Saldana as Neytiri are the biggest things that carry the movie to 6 points.",positive
Avatar:The Way of Water,8,"Avater the way of water is an incredibly beautiful film. It continues the story from the first film. The film is a must-see because it is a visual masterpiece. The story is illogical in some parts but overall it is ok. Sometimes the scenes were long winded and didn't have much value to the story a shortening of a few scenes wouldn't be bad. The world (Pandora) is presented in great detail. You learn more about the planet and the creatures that live there. Fans of the first film who have waited 13 years will not be disappointed. You should definitely watch the film, because it is not every day that there are such great films that take you on a journey into their world.",positive
Avatar:The Way of Water,7,"Although I don't think it was as good as the original, this is definitely worth your time. Awesome visuals and action. The only significant complaint I have is that it goes on for too long, probably a solid 30 minutes of bloat that doesn't need to be there.",positive
Avatar:The Way of Water,6,"The best 3d effects ive seen in a movie to date. Most of the best parts of the movie are in the first hour though, didnt really care for the beach environment, kinda dull compared to the jungle. Movie defitiely couldve been 15-25 min shorter as the main characters and story basically take a break in the middle of the film for filler. Pretty good for a first watch, but would be harder to rewatch given the length and thin plot...",positive

Avatar:The Way of Water,10,This movie extremely well made . Even do is now with Disney. Cameron still made his art come to life from a village stand point and best survival instinct . If you really think about it avatar is like a join of human and machines . Story is fantastic . I was entertain the hole way. A movie with a story and no agenda . I really wanted to see it again like in a few days . It was that good.Totally free to be on the movie with my thoughts and just relax to a great story effects and Beauty artwork and music,positive
Avatar:The Way of Water,5,"Visually very beautiful and different, but the story felt weak and the same as with so many other movies of its genre.",negative
Avatar:The Way of Water,8,Really worth the time to go see in the Cinema. The visuals really life this above most movies. Wasn't a fan of the first movie but this one has a much stronger story.,positive
Captain America: Civil War,6,Film with a pleasant plot and innovative narrative elements compared to the classic Marvel film,positive
Captain America: Civil War,6,"good if you turn your brain off, very fun with great character moments for captain america",positive
Captain America: Civil War,3,"I personally believe the better alternative title for the movie is Iron Man 4: Civil Scrimmage. Like the entire movie is literally summarized by that. As a person who has also read the Civil War comic, this movie takes a huge dump on it.",negative
Captain America: Civil War,7,"An impassioned disagreement splits Earth's greatest superteam in half and ultimately drives them to fight with more than just words. Captain America 3 is basically The Avengers 2.5, but you already knew that. And like the two preceding, star-studded chapters, most of what makes it work is the thrill of seeing all the big names geared up together, slinging zingers and blowing dollars through the VFX budget like t-shirts from a cannon. Civil War represents a more serious take for the series, sober and steely outside of a few great jabs from the new guys (Ant-Man and Spider-Man steal the show on this front). Which is fine, it adds a necessary level of gravitas to the subject and it wouldn't seem proper for Iron Man to be going all tongue-in-cheek while he's trying to punch his buddy's eyebrows off. That heavy-duty weight can make the film feel long and overstuffed, though, and all told I was feeling a bit weary by the time it got around to wrapping itself up. There's a whole lot of action, as you'd have to expect, but this time it feels less grounded than in the past. It's as comic book as the MCU has ever been, really, with loads of Kool Aid-colored lights flashing around the room, bodies careening through walls and one ridiculous chase scene in which our heroes sprint through traffic at highway speeds. And that's the focus, no doubt about it: action with a side of Bucky, whose quest for answers and redemption seems far more important than the moral dilemmas and personality clashes that divided The Avengers. Personally, I was more interested in that lesser-explored gray area, but at the end of the day it's Cap on the marquee so I can understand the emphasis on his pet plot threads. Civil War is a strong entry and a fine continuation of this cornerstone franchise, but at times it tries to pull off too much. Could've easily been broken into two films, and I'm almost never one to recommend trying something like that.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,9,"Making the climax not about that stellar airport brawl, which was very tempting I'm sure, but instead about the very messy breakup of Cap and Iron Man, was a genius move that elevates everything else about the movie. This is a soap opera. Melodrama of the highest order. And the character beats are *perfect*. They also resisted the urge to make Cap's reunion with Peggy sappy and free of pain, instead realistically depicting how brutal it would be with her age and health.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,8,"Above average Marvel movie for sure. Aside from the mediocre ending and the reliance on the Winter Soldier as a plot device, the story was great. The villain is both vicious and believable, and the two factions of the Avengers both have good reasons for opposing each other. Definitely a must-watch for any Marvel fan.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,10,"The best movie of this trilogy and among the best of Marvel. The movie has a lot of characters (about 15 or more), but it still tells Cap's story and Origin ends it in this trilogy. The movie shows us a version of Spider-Man that is not bad at all and makes us want to see his own special movie. The movie is full of action sequences, which are among the best of Marvel and the entire history of comic book adaptation. My film is full of sequences that refer to their source and the rest of the comics. But none of these are the strengths and achievements of the film. The achievement of the film is that, like the action sequences, it has given a purpose to each character. That is, in the world of Iron Man comics. It was actually a bad story, but here it also had a purpose and we wanted to see who would win until the end. This is the achievement of the film.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,10,Wow!!! Is the first thing that comes to mind. Insanely good movie. Plus the introduction of Black Panthe,positive
Captain America: Civil War,7,Not even close to the comic book version for sure. Way more toned down and safe for the normie audiences for sure. Still I liked it enough and the ending was pretty epic for sure.,positive
Captain America: Civil War,8,"Captain America: Civil War does everything that Avengers: Age of Ultron didn't do and does it ten thousand times better. It's not an Avengers 2.5, it's the actual second Avengers movie.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,6,"good if you turn your brain off, very fun with great character moments for captain america",positive
Captain America: Civil War,9,"Yeah it's a good movie, and it puts DC in it's place, I love almost everything about this movie",positive
Captain America: Civil War,2,"This is supposedly a movie dealing with superhero regulation, but instead of exploring it in any way, the filmmakers just move their characters into empty, gray parking lots. If there's anything you hate about the MCU as a franchise, it is prominently featured in Civil War.",negative
Captain America: Civil War,5,The best part of the movie is the airport fight scene. Watch a clip on YouTube to get the same experience. Other than the parts with Black Panther and Spider-Man it's just meh.,negative
Captain America: Civil War,8,"It was a well-made movie the only disappointment is the villain was a bit weak and could have been stringer and how captain America screen time could have been more as it felt more like an Avengers film rather then captain America, other then that great film",positive
Captain America: Civil War,7,A bit rushed but definitely worthwhile. The action packed captian America movie feels more like an avengers film due to how packed it is . Picking up right after the devastating caused by Ultron in the age of Ultron Civil War is a no holds barred battle of contrasting morality between Iron man & captain America.,positive
Captain America: Civil War,7,"Finally, a non-conventional superhero film, that has a genius of a villain, some great dilemmas of our characters, some great fights, realistic twists, action sequences, some thought-provoking moral questions, that absolutely can happen if heroes would exist. It's the best in the trilogy. By far. It is really not even close.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,7,"It is a great idea to show us the divide in the Avengers team as the big villain of the movie, because it is different to the other Marvel movies and also interesting: it leads to the main question: more state influence or independence. Action and visual effects are top as always, especially, when the super heroes are fighting each other But somehow there are too many characters and this isnt a Captain America movie in my view, it is an Avenger movie. Also I didnt like the gender mainstreaming elements in the beginning of the movie.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,9,"Captain America: Civil War is the best film in the Captain America trilogy. A great sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Strong confrontation between the main characters, A well-written plot that reveals the characters. One of the best films in the Marvel film universe.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,7,"More-or-less the good version of Batman v Superman. It's surprising how similar Civil War and BvS really are. Both films attempt a realistic superhero story, but stray a little too far into a CNN-like political debate. However, Civil War works where BvS didn't for several reasons: Its themes are treated with more intelligence, its technical execution is far superior, and because the audience already has an attachment to both Captain America and Iron Man, the conflict between the two heroes holds much greater weight.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,10,This movie is SUPERB on SO MANY LEVELS!!!! The storylines were KILLER!!!! CHADWICK BOSEMAN kicked the DOOR DOWN as T'challa! I absolutely LOOOOOVED when HAWKEYE made his entrance! Lol Plus ANT-MAN and PETER PARKER! I could go on and on about this movie! One of the best EVER!,positive
Captain America: Civil War,8,"One year after defeating Ultron, the Avengers are attempting to stop a terrorist from stealing a biological weapon in Lagos. In an attempt to kill Rogers one of the terrorists blows himself up, and in telekinetically diverting the explosion Maximoff accidentally destroys a nearby building killing several Wakandan humanitarian workers in the process. The event leads to the United Nations seeking to have greater control of the team and creating a divide between them. Featuring a plethora of Marvel characters (both old and new) Civil War is an Avengers movie is all but name, and with the characters facing up against each other it certainly feels different from other movies in the MCU.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,8,"Civil War is still a great movie I really love this movie. From the characters being well fleshed out as well as the action scenes being so great and personal. Also, the story is very unique with the heroes fighting each other. Also, it is the first time we saw Black panther and that was a lot of fun. And I thought the villain was decent. But let's be honest the story is pretty flaws and I just on big contrivance. but still, I think it's a great movie.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,5,The most average trilogy i have ever seen. It´s just okay that I can´t take it.,negative
Captain America: Civil War,0,"The bigger these movies become, the smaller they feel. The more aggressively they",negative
Captain America: Civil War,9,Civil War is the film that made people have the interest again to continue seeing more of their cinematographic universe.,positive
Captain America: Civil War,4,This movie is honestly bad and really overrated I was really bored watching it although not as bored as Thor the dark world,negative
Captain America: Civil War,9,This movie confirms what many of us have thought for a long time. Captain America is the character with the best trilogy in the MCU.,positive
Captain America: Civil War,10,"An amazing experience. The third Captain America film is more of an Avengers movie. It fully delivers and got the Russo brothers even more attention and fame. It is based or inspired by the huge Civil War Marvel comic event. This was epic as it put heroes against heroes, tore apart teams, families and friendships while having serious impacts and causalities. While we were talking before who is stronger or the better hero now we were talking who was right or how much is acceptable in the security vs freedom dilemma. So the expectations were high for the movie and it fully delivered. It is a gamechanger and will have impacts even up to Avengers Endgame. Lets start with a set up. Approx a year after the events of Age of Ultron the Avengers are on a mission in Africa. However not everything goes smoothly and so the United Nations want to make some additional rules for them. Bucky struggles with his past as Winter Soldier and newfound freedom while Helmut Zemo a former high ranking officer from Sokovia (Devastated by collateral damage in another movie) starts a scheme that will change everything. The story is magnificent. It works well in tandem with the characters. You can understand their motivation and feel their emotions, struggles and doubts. Also they gave us Spiderman and Black Panther. Both characters are well introduced and I wanted to see more of them. Of cause the action works well and the airport battle and final fight are awesome. This is the strength of the Russo brothers. They mix great stories with character development and garner it with humor and action. Bonus: This movie gave us a lot to discus. Be it morals, philosophies, security vs freedom or who is right and wrong (Both sides have their pros and cons). Lets continue with the characters. We have all Avengers except Hulk and Thor. The main characters are Captain America / Steve Rogers played by Chris Evans and Tony Stark / Iron Man played by Robert Downey Jr. Both are truly excellent and make this enjoyable. To be fair I see Tony Stark also as villain in this movie while I also admit that Steve makes some bad decisions. I continue with the newcomers. Chadwick Boseman works incredibly well as T’Challa / Black Panther. I am always amazed how the MCU made all the right choices for their characters. Same goes for Tom Holland as Spiderman. Only a shorter appearance but he also works so well that I wanted to see more. The established characters work really well to. Be it Scarlett Johanson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Jeremy Renner, Elisabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Paul Rudd or Don Cheadle. Everyone delivers and is worth watching. For the villains we have of cause Tony Stark who is not that much wrong. I say he is misguided and fails to see the bigger picture. The United nations in the MCU works not better than in real live and I do not want them to make the important decisions (if they can get even anything done). If you think I be harsh just google Rwanda genocide to see one of the hallmarks of their failings or what they got done to solve the Syrian war. Back to the movie. Then we have Daniel Brühl as Helmut Zemo. For me one of the best villains in the MCU and underrated Clarification: Of cause he is not as good as Thanos or N’Jadaka from Black Panther. I like him because I can see myself in him and T’Challa does this too as he walked the same path. Also he is just a normal human and pulls this of. Well done character and very good acting. I think I should also praise John Kani as T’Chaka and William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross her. In total an awesome cast and great performance. Presentation wise this movie is amazing. The special effects are excellent and enhance the scenes. Everything is immersive and believable. It is a hallmark of the MCU. It ends not here as the sets, costumes and choreography is also well done. There is no misstep here. The soundtrack rounds up this presentation. There are some slight negatives. I am surprised which side Black Widow picked and Vision too (but to a lesser content). Also some things should have more fallout. But those are small nitpicks in an amazing experience. Overall this was an amazing experience and a must see for me. With this all Captain America movies are great and the Russo will even go up to eleven with their next movies.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,8,"Some shoddy visuals and weird plotlines, as well as other leaps in logic without which the plot couldn't move forward. Also could have used some better directing in scenes to make them as heavy as they should've been. Overall though, pretty solid if you don't think about it too much.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,7,"It was with pleasure that I saw this film from the cinematographic franchise ""Captain America"". It is a franchise that has given rise to increasingly extraordinary and visually ambitious films. The connection to the previous film, ""Winter Soldier"", is very present, but I confess that I was left with the feeling that it would have been better to see the ""Avengers"" franchise first, in order to better understand the film, and the relational mechanics of the characters. I remember, as I said in other reviews, that the world of comics is a maze that I do not dominate at all. The plot revolves around a tense situation: after having made a lot of victims and material damage in their operations (finally, someone realized this), the Avengers were punished: they either subjected themselves to UN supervision or were considered outlaws. While the leader, Stark, accepts the impositions, Rogers sees them as an unfair limitation and bets on going his way, even if he breaks with his colleagues and, especially, Stark. At the same time, a subplot develops around Bucky Barnes, Rogers' childhood friend, and his mysterious past. The script is complex and full of details, subplots and nuances that can escape our gaze if we are not attentive or do not know the Marvel universe reasonably. I felt that sometimes the development of the script didn't quite know which way to go or what ideas to develop, and that several characters appear because they really had to be there, if only for a couple of minutes. The central core of characters, however, receives a very good treatment and has time to develop. I thought it was a little strange to see Spider-Man among all these people. He looks a little out of place. And in a film so loaded with good and great heroes, I missed a truly charismatic villain who balanced things out a bit. The cast is a real nest of stars: it is huge and full of notable names. Of course, the protagonist is Chris Evans, as Captain America. He is already fully acclimated to this character and knows perfectly what to do, and does his job flawlessly. Robert Downey Jr is the eternal Tony Stark, a character he was born to do and who does in an exceptional way. Scarlett Johansson and Sebastian Stan continue to be excellent, as they were in previous films. Paul Bettany seemed strangely robotic until I realized that he was really playing an android. Chadwick Boseman was excellent, serious and very focused. Elizabeth Olsen was fine, but not brilliant, and the same can be said of Emily VanCamp, in a relatively bland performance. Anthony Mackie showed up little and Don Cheadle just did what he really had to do. Technically, it is a film worthy of Marvel and of the quality to which it has accustomed us: it is an extraordinary and stylish visual show, where every detail has been thought out in a meticulous way to increase the audience's visual and auditory experience. Cinematography is great and the filming work has been wonderfully accomplished. Visual, special effects and CGI work add sparkle, power and visual depth. The editing work was very well done, with precise cuts and great balance. The action scenes, especially the one at the airport, are good and will satisfy the appetite of Marvel fans. The sets and costumes were also very well done and look authentic. The soundtrack is quite good, but I didn't feel it was something that was really in the ear.",positive
Captain America: Civil War,10,"Civil War is a perfect superhero film in my opinion. The story was always compelling, both sides make great points, the action sequences are SO good, especially the iconic airport fight scene! Black Panther and Spider-Man are also fantastic!",positive

Captain America: Civil War,10,"Sorry haters, but this is an ultimate win. The action, the plot twists, and an epic crossover that was very much needed before Infinity War. Great for all ages",positive
Captain America: Civil War,9,"First things first, this is an Avengers movie in disguise. Sure, Captain America is somewhat the focus, but the emotional core of the story comes from the conflict between every member of the team, especially Steve and Tony. This movie surprisingly holds back on the action to give us many scenes of characters talking and debating. That's not to say that there's no action, 'cause there's still a lot, but the main conflict comes from the more relatively quiet scenes. The action is just a culmination of the tension set up there. I really love how the big bombastic battle isn't the climax. The climax is instead a more personal and visceral fight between three characters. Also, Zemo is one the franchise's best villains. It's just a great movie all around and possibly my favorite MCU movie. RIP Chadwick Boseman.",positive
